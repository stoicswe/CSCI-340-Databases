With this project, I felt a bit confused when it came to the attempt to find the best max keys according to the scenarios, so I have output reccorded for each run I have coded.

In this project, I have learned how memory works and also how efficient btrees are, in comparison to another data structure, such as an array.

Below are my resuls for a given MAX_KEYS:

Max Keys: 4
